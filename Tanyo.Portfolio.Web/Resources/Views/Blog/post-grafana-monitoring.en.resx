    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>This workspace has statistics on CPU usage, memory, hard disk, CPU temperature, other resources, SWAP memory, and server downtime.

There are some things I don't like frankly about Grafana. The first is that I don't get many things ready-made and I have to do everything myself or download a dashboard from the internet and modify it for my needs. The second thing, and the most important for me, is that parsing itself uses a lot of resources and is a bit of an overhead. In addition, when a dashboard is created, we have to use different datasets, which also allocate certain memory from that of the machine. Node_Exporter uses a lot of memory and I will look into reducing it in the future.

I use another desktop that gives me statistics about Docker and the containers in it. From there I learned about memory allocation by the various exporters. It gives me a clearer view of container performance, and based on that I can decide who to allocate how much memory to, and if it's a hand-built system, where to improve it. Here is the second work environment:</value>

    <value>In this post I will show you how I analyze and view my server statistics. It was a long selection process and I went through quite a few analysis tools before choosing this one. At first I knew that Grafana is a good tool and thought about it, but I didn't want to become trivial and decided to try Netdata, DataDog, then I tried Checkmk, then WebMin, then others, but in the end I decided that Grafana is the tool, which gives me the most freedom to change the view and the largest set of statistics, although I think Netdata gives quite a lot out-of-the-box instead of manually creating them yourself.

Here you can see a picture of my main Grafana workspace. This is my home page and shows resource usage.
I have others that show the use of containers etc:</value>

    <value>Overall, Grafana has its pros and cons. I have used quite a few other tools, such as Microsoft's AppInsights, which gave me pretty good stats and didn't hurt productivity. But that's if we're using Azure, and I'm currently on a Docker host and self-hosted. I also can't see yet a place to get Alerts notifications and detailed system error data like DataDog has. I used DataDog at first, but I don't want the systems data to be kept in foreign companies, so I feel like I don't own the data, it's being used by other people, especially if they're analyzing data.

Overall, Grafana gives quite a bit of freedom, privacy and beautiful presentation of the data.

I hope you enjoyed what I wrote, I tried to save as much detail as possible.

Thank you for reading, See you soon,
