                            Hello,<br />
                            In the last post I described how I've got a Ransoware attack from a hacker and all my backups were encrypted with a strong hashing algorithm. <br />
                            I spent some time to research how this can be resolved and found that the hash cannot be decrypted. <br />
                            Sometimes people paid to the hackers, but ofthen the hackers disapeared and sent some ransomware attacks in the future too, so I decided not to take any action. <br />
                            The backups were not so important as I keep most of my projects in the cloud so If I remove them I will not loose a lot. <br />
                            <br />
                            I decided to re-install everything and put strong security to my host. <br />
                            I tried some famouse operation systems, but in the end I realised that there is no better system for me than DietPi! <br />
                            I was not sure if it will work only on Raspberry Pi as in the name of the operation system there is a 'Pi' word, but then I opened the website and found that it works on almost any kind of machines, ARM, PC etc.. <br />
                            That's great!<br />
                            <br />
                            I deleted everything, re-installed with DietPi and worked as a charm.<br />
                            The CPU usage is 3 times lower thatn Debian, the RAM usage as twice less. <br />
                            There are loads of pre-defined commands and backup software and it was more than better than the Debian OS that I used before. <br />
                            <br />
                            Now I feel much better. <br />
                            <br />
                            I had a spare Raspberry Pi and installed on it DietPi on it too. <br />
                            Through the command 'dietpi-software' you can install all kind of pre-configured software. <br />
                            I choosed Kodi and voila! I made a TV Box. <br />
                            I had also an OctoPi OS for my 3D printers and I relised I don't need it too! <br />
                            There I installed DietPi + Docker and OctoPi container for each printer instead to have a single board with single OctoPi instance. <br />
                            Now I am able to manage multiple 3D Printers and send files to them in paralel. <br />
                            I heared about OctoFarm docker image, but when I tested it it happened that it does not work on ARM devices even if I put the platform statement in the docker compose file. <br />
                            For now I am using just the OctoPi containers and is fine as it is.<br />
                            <br />
                            As a summay I would say that after trying more than 25 different OS I am sure that DietPi is my Favourite OS! Works everywhere, the most lightweight, predefined commands and software for everything! What can you want more! I am thinging of starting to donate them in Patreon. <br />
