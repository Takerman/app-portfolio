                            I thought for long time until I defined my average prices as I wanted they to be cheap for the clients and optimized for me and them. After I decied to be self-employed I saw how much we can save from additional taxation from the government and to be easier for them to pay me. They just made a payment, I send them invoice and that's everything. I am paying my insurance, government taxes at the minimum for my country and taxes for accountant. The prices are listed on the homepage and they are synchronized with the sheet that I created

                            Please feel free to comment them with me and to use the average for the project you want to develop.
